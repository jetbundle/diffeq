    "\n",
    "In previous episodes, we viewed a differential equation as an operator $\\mathcal{L}$ acting on a function space. We asked: \"Which function $u$ makes $\\mathcal{L}u = 0$?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In eps. 6, we invert this perspective. We realize that \"derivatives\" are not actions, but **independent coordinates**. A differential equation is not a problem to be solved, but a submanifold sitting inside a larger space called a **Jet Bundle**. Solving the equation means finding a surface that fits inside this submanifold while remaining tangent to a special \"contact structure.\"\n",

    "This geometric viewpoint allows us to handle overdetermined systems, classify singularities via algebra (Spencer Cohomology), and study equations that evolve the geometry of the universe itself (Ricci Flow).\n"

    "### 2.1 The 1-Jet Space ($J^1$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\pi: E \\to M$ be a fiber bundle (e.g., $M$ is space, $E$ is the field). The **1-Jet Bundle** $J^1(E)$ has coordinates $(x, u, p)$, where $p$ represents the first derivative.\n",

    "A \"solution\" is a section $u: M \\to E$ that \"lifts\" to a surface in $J^1(E)$ given by $(x, u(x), u'(x))$.\n",

    "### 2.2 The Contact Structure\n",

    "$$\\theta = du - p \\, dx = 0$$\n",

    "A valid solution requires $\\theta = 0$. Geometrically, this defines a field of hyperplanes (contact planes) at every point in $J^1(E)$. A solution is an **Integral Manifold** of this distribution—a surface that is everywhere tangent to these planes.\n",

    "### 2.3 The PDE as a Submanifold\n",
    "\n",
    "A first-order PDE $F(x, u, p) = 0$ is simply a hypersurface $\\Sigma \\subset J^1(E)$ defined by the zero set of $F$. Solving the PDE is equivalent to finding an integral manifold of the contact system that lies entirely inside $\\Sigma$.\n"
